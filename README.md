# bblas_interleaved
Basic implementation of batched DGEMM using an interleaved memory layout suitable for 
use on multicore systems and the self-hosted Intel Xeon Phi (KNL).

We can achieve exceptionally good performance for small matrix sizes when compared to MKL.

## Compilation
Discuss how to compile on multi-core and Xeon Phi architectures (edit Makefile).

## Paper
Give link to paper discussing the results.
